        <h2>Welcome to the World of DevOps</h2>
        <p>DevOps bridges the gap between development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming for a shorter development life cycle, continuous delivery, and high software quality. This collaborative approach fosters a culture of integration and automation, significantly enhancing the software development process.</p>

        <h2>Understanding AWS Route 53 Routing Policies</h2>
        <p>AWS Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It plays a crucial role in managing traffic for your web applications through various routing policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple Routing:</strong> Directs traffic to a single resource.</li>
            <li><strong>Weighted Routing:</strong> Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on assigned weights.</li>
            <li><strong>Latency Routing:</strong> Routes traffic based on the lowest latency for the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Failover Routing:</strong> Routes traffic to a secondary resource if the primary is unavailable.</li>
            <li><strong>Geolocation Routing:</strong> Routes traffic based on the geographical location of the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Geoproximity Routing (Traffic Flow only):</strong> Routes traffic based on the geographic location of your resources and users, with optional bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Multivalue Answer Routing:</strong> Responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.</li>
        </ul>
